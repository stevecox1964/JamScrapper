# TODO

## Working
- Audio capture + FFT streaming at 30fps
- 7 visualizer modes (bars, waveform, radial, tunnel, galaxy, terrain, starfield)
- Media detection via Windows "Now Playing" (works with Spotify, YouTube Music)
- Artist profile system (genres, colors, images, mood tags)
- Audio fingerprinting module (needs AcoustID API key to activate)

## Known Limitations
- Pandora web player doesn't expose song metadata through Chrome's media session
- Audio fingerprinting requires free AcoustID API key + fpcalc install

## Next Up
- Beat detection (pulse effects on kicks, flash on snares)
- Keyboard shortcuts to cycle visualizer modes
- Fullscreen toggle
- Smooth transitions between modes
- Bass energy driving camera shake / color intensity in 3D modes

## Future
- Plugin architecture for drop-in visualizer engines
- Song-specific choreographed animations
- More visualizer modes (spectrum waterfall, DNA helix, etc.)
- Artist imagery integrated into 3D visualizers
